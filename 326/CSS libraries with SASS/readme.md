## Live Sass Compiler Setup

This project uses the Live Sass Compiler extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to automatically compile `.scss` files into `.css` as you work. Follow the instructions below to enable and use the Live Sass Compiler.

### Steps to Enable Live Sass Compiler

1. **Install the Extension**

   - Go to the [Live Sass Compiler Extension page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.Live-Sass-Compiler) and click the green "Install" button.
   - Alternatively, you can open the Extensions view in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`, then search for "Live Sass Compiler" and click on the one by **Glenn Marks** to install it.

2. **Open Your SCSS File**

   - Make sure you have your `.scss` file open in VS Code (not necessarily active in the editor, but present in the Explorer panel).

3. **Click the “Watch Sass” Button**

   - Look at the bottom-right corner of the Visual Studio Code interface, and you should see a button that says **"Watch Sass"**.
   - Click this button, and the extension will automatically generate a `{filename}.css` and `{filename}.map.css` file in the directory where the `.scss` file is located.

4. **Watch and Enjoy!**
   - Now you can watch and compile your Sass files in real-time without having to run commands in the terminal every time you want to reload!
   - The Live Sass Compiler will handle it for you automatically, making your development process smoother.
